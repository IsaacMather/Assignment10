#time complexity
It may be O(n), look at the emperical time complexity.
Because it travels to each of the nodes for sure. The complexity could be n^2
because of how the nodes grow.

Is there a reason it wouldn't visit a smaller postion of the nodes as the
graphs get larger?

#but lets look at the emperical complexity

#take a look at the numbers collected, and see how it grows with time

TODO:
Questions:
#how do we appropriately handle the size problem? is it range(size -1?)

#i think the create graph seems OK? Maybe? How do i know?

#djikstra_solve is being passed a pair of tuples? How do i drill in to that?


dont want to print the maze size

change the bias to .25, and then .75
