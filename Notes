#time complexity
It may be O(n), look at the emperical time complexity.
Because it travels to each of the nodes for sure. The complexity could be n^2
because of how the nodes grow.

Is there a reason it wouldn't visit a smaller postion of the nodes as the
graphs get larger?

#but lets look at the emperical complexity

#take a look at the numbers collected, and see how it grows with time
